# Academic Template 

Code for my own academic website. Forked from [markoshorro's `academic-template repository](https://github.com/markoshorro/academic-template). It is a Bootstrap template, so better refer the [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) for changing the style.

This project is meant to directly clone in your servers' `public_html` folder, since it has all
the dependencies.

## Live demo

I have used this style for my [personal webpage](https://cse.msu.edu/~sadiyasa/)

## Basic changes

* Colors: css/custom.css
* Structure: index.html
* Pictures: img/folder

## License

MIT License. Publications sections uses
[bib-publication-list](https://github.com/vkaravir/bib-publication-list)
project for displaying a graph with all the publications.
